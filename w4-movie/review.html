                    The movie opens up with Chris Parker excitedly lip-syncing and dancing through her room while she gets ready for a date with her boyfriend. He shows up only to cancel on her, so she winds up taking a babysitting job instead. Her friend Brenda runs away from home and calls Chris collect from the bus station in the city. She asks Chris to come pick her up so Sara, Brad, and Daryl threaten to blackmail Chis if she doesn’t take them with her. On their way into the city they get a flat tire and have to pull of the highway. A tow truck driver comes along and saves them after she finds out there is no spare and that she left her wallet back at the house.

                    In a crazy turn of events they wind up in a stolen car and locked away in the office of the theft ring’s operation where Daryl steals a very important magazine as they escape. While being chased they wind up on stage and have to sing their way off again. They run into the subway and stumble in the middle of a gang fight and Brad gets stubbed in the foot so, they have to go to the hospital. Later they come along a frat party and Sara says she has to use the bathroom. Chris meets Dan, a college boy who loans her the money for her car repairs and gives them a ride to the garage.

                    Chris winds up driving by the restaurant her boyfriend was supposed to take her to for their anniversary dinner and she figures out he took another girl with him to dinner instead. Sara gets chased by the leaders of the theft ring and sees her dads building in the distance, so she runs to it. There is quite a series of events that take place keeping you on the edge of your seat until they get the car and get Brenda safely from the bus station. Everyone makes it home safely in a dash to end and pull it all off without the parents finding out.
